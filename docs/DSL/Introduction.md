- **What are fields and draw shaders**
  - *Fields* are properties that define the state and behavior of widgets. They allow you to customize widgets by setting values for size, color, layout, and more.
  - *DrawShaders* are shaders used to render the visual appearance of widgets. They define how the widget is drawn on the screen.

- [Layouting](Layouting.md)
- [Expressions](expressions.md) // i.e. for centralizing values
- [Inheritance](inheritance.md) // i.e. for custom widgets. Explain attribute overwriting as a strategy for building custom DSL-only widgets.
  - Inheritance allows you to create custom widgets by extending existing ones. You can overwrite attributes to modify behavior and appearance, enabling the creation of complex widgets with minimal code.
