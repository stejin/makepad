# close_path

```glsl
fn close_path(inout self)
```

The `close_path` function completes the current path by drawing a line from the last point back to the starting point. This effectively closes the shape, ensuring that it is a continuous loop. It's commonly used when you need to create closed shapes like polygons.

## Parameters

- **self** (inout): A reference to the `Sdf2d` instance. The function updates the internal state of `self` by connecting the current position back to the starting position of the path.

## Returns

- **void**: This function does not return a value but modifies the `Sdf2d` context to close the current path.

## Example

```glsl
fn pixel(self) -> vec4 {
    // Create an Sdf2d drawing context for the current viewport.
    let sdf = Sdf2d::viewport(self.pos * self.rect_size);

    // Start a new path at point (50.0, 10.0).
    sdf.move_to(50.0, 10.0);

    // Draw lines to create a triangle.
    sdf.line_to(90.0, 80.0);   // Line to point (90.0, 80.0).
    sdf.line_to(10.0, 80.0);   // Line to point (10.0, 80.0);
    
    // Close the path, connecting back to the starting point.
    sdf.close_path();

    // Fill the shape with a solid red color.
    sdf.fill(#f00);

    // Return the final color result.
    return sdf.result;
}
```

### Explanation

In this example:

- **Create Drawing Context**: We initialize an `Sdf2d` drawing context using the current position (`self.pos`) and size (`self.rect_size`) of the viewport.
- **Start Path**: We set the starting point of our path to `(50.0, 10.0)` using `sdf.move_to`.
- **Draw Lines**: We draw two lines to create the sides of a triangle:
  - From the starting point to `(90.0, 80.0)` using `sdf.line_to(90.0, 80.0)`.
  - Then to `(10.0, 80.0)` using `sdf.line_to(10.0, 80.0)`.
- **Close Path**: We use `sdf.close_path()` to draw a line from the current point back to the starting point `(50.0, 10.0)`, completing the triangle.
- **Apply Fill**: We fill the closed path with red color using `sdf.fill(#f00)`.
- **Return Result**: We return `sdf.result`, which contains the final rendered color after all drawing operations.

### Notes

- **Path Creation**: The combination of `move_to`, `line_to`, and `close_path` allows you to construct complex shapes by defining their outlines point by point.
- **State Management**: The `close_path` function uses the `start_pos` and `last_pos` internally to determine where to draw the closing line.
- **Drawing Order**: Ensure that you define your entire path and call `close_path` before applying fills or strokes to render the shape correctly.
