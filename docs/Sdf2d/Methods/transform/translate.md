# translate

```glsl
fn translate(inout self, x: float, y: float) -> vec2
```

The `translate` function applies a translation transformation to the coordinate system of the `Sdf2d` drawing context. It shifts the origin of the coordinate system by the specified amounts along the x and y axes. This affects all subsequent drawing operations, allowing you to move shapes and paths within the context.

## Parameters

- **self** (inout): A reference to the `Sdf2d` instance. The function modifies `self.pos` in place, updating the coordinate system of the drawing context.

- **x** (`float`): The distance to translate along the x-axis. Positive values move the drawing context to the left, negative values move it to the right.

- **y** (`float`): The distance to translate along the y-axis. Positive values move the drawing context downward, negative values move it upward.

## Returns

- **vec2**: The updated position (`self.pos`) of the drawing context after the translation.

## Example

```glsl
fn pixel(self) -> vec4 {
    // Initialize the Sdf2d drawing context relative to the viewport size.
    let sdf = Sdf2d::viewport(self.pos * self.rect_size);
    
    // Apply translation of 30 units left and 20 units down.
    sdf.translate(30.0, 20.0);
    
    // Draw a rectangle with rounded corners after translation.
    sdf.box(10.0, 10.0, 80.0, 80.0, 5.0);
    
    // Fill the rectangle with red color.
    sdf.fill(#f00);
    
    // Return the final color result.
    return sdf.result;
}
```

### Explanation

In this example:

- **Initialize Drawing Context**: We create an `Sdf2d` instance by scaling `self.pos` by `self.rect_size`, which represents the size of the viewport.

- **Apply Translation**: We call `sdf.translate(30.0, 20.0)` to shift the coordinate system. This moves the origin (0, 0) of the drawing context 30 units to the right and 20 units upward. Note that translation values subtract from `self.pos`.

- **Draw Shape**: We draw a rectangle starting at position `(10.0, 10.0)` with a width and height of `80.0` units and corner radius of `5.0`. Because of the translation, this rectangle appears shifted in the output.

- **Apply Fill**: We fill the rectangle with red color using `sdf.fill(#f00)`.

- **Return Result**: We return `sdf.result`, which contains the final rendered color after the drawing operations.

### Notes

- **Direction of Translation**: The `translate` function subtracts the given values from the current position (`self.pos`). This means that positive values of `x` and `y` move the drawing context to the left and downward, respectively, relative to the original coordinate system.

- **Effect on Subsequent Drawing**: All drawing operations after the translation are affected by the coordinate shift. This allows you to position multiple shapes relative to the translated coordinate system.

- **Cumulative Transformations**: Multiple transformations (e.g., `translate`, `rotate`, `scale`) are cumulative and affect subsequent drawing operations in the order they are applied.

- **Return Value**: The function returns the updated `self.pos`, which can be useful if you need to know the new position after translation for calculations.
