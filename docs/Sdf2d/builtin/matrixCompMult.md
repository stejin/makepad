matrixCompMult â€” perform a component-wise multiplication of two matrices
## Declaration
- ``mat2 matrixCompMult(mat2 x, mat2 y)``
- ``mat3 matrixCompMult(mat3 x, mat3 y)``
- ``mat4 matrixCompMult(mat4 x, mat4 y)``
## Parameters
- ``x``:  Specifies the first matrix multiplicand.
- ``y``:  Specifies the second matrix multiplicand.
## Description
`matrixCompMult` performs a component-wise multiplication of two matrices, yielding a result matrix where each component, `result[i][j]` is computed as the scalar product of ``x[i][j]`` and ``y[i][j]``.
